# WorkTimeStat
A very small app for the purpose of keeping track of when you take up work and when you finish.
This allows you to keep track of your hours, so you always know how much more you need to work on each day.

It also includes a simple tracker app which watches mouse and keyboard usage and gives an indicative amount of how much you actually used the computer. 
The time resolution of this can be set in settings.
